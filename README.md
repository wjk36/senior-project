2021 Physics Senior Project -> Special Relativity Simulations

This project simulates the idea of Special Relativity! 

It was a part of my senior research capstone which dealt with analyzing the use of simulations as teaching methods in physics. 

These particular simulations deal with the ideas of switching frames and simultaneity in Special Relativity.
